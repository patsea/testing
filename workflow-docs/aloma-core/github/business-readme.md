## What This Automation Does (In Simple Terms)

- **Finds all your connector projects** in your company’s GitHub account.
- **Checks which ones need a new release** by looking at their latest version tags.
- **Creates and publishes new releases** with the right version numbers, every time.
- **Updates the connector images** so everything stays current.
- **Lets you know when the job is done**—no more guessing or manual checks.

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. Find All Connector Projects
- **What happens:** The automation looks through your company’s GitHub to list every project.
- **Real-world comparison:** Like a filing clerk going through every folder in the office to make a master list.
- **Why it matters:** Ensures nothing gets missed—every connector project is considered.
- **Dependencies:** Your GitHub organization name must be correct and up to date.

### 2. Filter for Connector Projects
- **What happens:** From the big list, it picks out only the projects that are connectors (those with names starting with "connector-").
- **Real-world comparison:** Like sorting a stack of mail and keeping only the envelopes marked “Urgent.”
- **Why it matters:** Focuses only on the relevant projects, saving time and avoiding mistakes.
- **Dependencies:** Project naming conventions must be followed (all connector projects should start with "connector-").

### 3. Check the Latest Version Tag for Each Connector
- **What happens:** For each connector, it checks what the latest version is.
- **Real-world comparison:** Like checking the last stamp on a document to see when it was last updated.
- **Why it matters:** Prevents accidental duplicate releases and keeps everything organized.
- **Dependencies:** Each project should use tags for versioning.

### 4. Create and Publish a New Release Tag
- **What happens:** If a new release is needed, it creates a new version tag and publishes the release.
- **Real-world comparison:** Like a personal assistant stamping “Approved” on a new document and filing it in the right place.
- **Why it matters:** Ensures releases are consistent and always follow the right version order.
- **Dependencies:** The automation needs permission to create releases in your GitHub projects.

### 5. Classify Commit in Main Branch
- **What happens:** It checks if a new commit on the main branch should trigger a release.
- **Real-world comparison:** Like a supervisor reviewing a new memo to decide if it needs to be sent out to the whole team.
- **Why it matters:** Only important changes get released, avoiding unnecessary updates.
- **Dependencies:** Commits must be pushed to the main branch, and project names should be correct.

### 6. Get the Latest Tag for a Specific Project
- **What happens:** Looks up the most recent tag for a particular connector.
- **Real-world comparison:** Like checking the last entry in a project’s logbook.
- **Why it matters:** Makes sure the next release number is always correct.
- **Dependencies:** Tags must be kept up to date in each project.

### 7. Calculate the Next Release Version
- **What happens:** Figures out what the next version number should be (for example, 1.0.1 becomes 1.0.2).
- **Real-world comparison:** Like updating the next invoice number in your billing system.
- **Why it matters:** Keeps your releases in order and avoids confusion.
- **Dependencies:** Previous version tags must follow a standard numbering system.

### 8. Create a New Tag
- **What happens:** Adds the new version tag to the project.
- **Real-world comparison:** Like putting a new label on a file folder before it goes into the cabinet.
- **Why it matters:** Makes it easy to find and track releases later.
- **Dependencies:** The project must allow tags to be created.

### 9. Publish the Release
- **What happens:** Makes the new release official and visible in GitHub.
- **Real-world comparison:** Like sending out a company-wide memo that a new policy is live.
- **Why it matters:** Everyone can see and use the latest version right away.
- **Dependencies:** Release permissions must be set in GitHub.

### 10. Mark Release as Complete
- **What happens:** Confirms the release is finished and records it.
- **Real-world comparison:** Like checking off a task as “done” on your to-do list.
- **Why it matters:** Keeps your release process tidy and auditable.
- **Dependencies:** Release status must be tracked.

### 11. Update the Connector Image
- **What happens:** Updates the connector’s image to match the new release.
- **Real-world comparison:** Like updating the company logo on all new documents after a rebrand.
- **Why it matters:** Ensures everyone is using the latest, most secure version.
- **Dependencies:** The image update service must be available and accessible.

### 12. Confirm Image Update Success
- **What happens:** Checks that the image update worked and marks the job as complete.
- **Real-world comparison:** Like double-checking that the new logo prints correctly before sending out new letterhead.
- **Why it matters:** Catches any issues early, so nothing slips through the cracks.
- **Dependencies:** The update system must return a success confirmation.

### 13. Complete the Task
- **What happens:** The automation wraps up and marks the whole process as finished.
- **Real-world comparison:** Like closing the file drawer at the end of the day, knowing everything’s in its place.
- **Why it matters:** You can trust that the job is done, every time.
- **Dependencies:** The system must track when tasks are finished.

## Decision Points (for Branching Logic)

### Main Decision: Should a Commit Trigger a Release?
- **Simple Explanation:** The automation checks if a new change in the main branch of a connector project is important enough to need a new release.
- **Path A (Release Needed):**
  - Classify Commit in Main Branch
  - Get the Latest Tag for a Specific Project
  - Calculate the Next Release Version
  - Create a New Tag
  - Publish the Release
  - Mark Release as Complete
  - Update the Connector Image
  - Confirm Image Update Success
  - Complete the Task
- **Path B (No Release Needed):**
  - The automation skips the release steps and waits for the next relevant change.

**How Different Paths Serve Different Needs:**  
- Path A ensures important updates are released quickly and reliably.
- Path B avoids unnecessary work, keeping things efficient and focused.
